### Introduction

This shiny application is a real time bike station information. It provides information on  more than 30 bike self-service stations around the world.
This application is composed of an interface file (**ui.R**), a server file (**server.R**), and folder where we can find data (**www**).


You can see the shiny application in action [here](http://blog.rdata.lu/visualization/bike/)




### Before running the code

Before running the code you should run data_dist.R on R to generate, the file closest_stations.RDS (this file is to large to be save in GitHub). Then you will be abble to run the shiny app.
The offline version is veloh_API_offline.R, if you have any difficulty to make it run offline, contact me :)
The shiny server version is ui.R and Server.R

Don't forget to change the path (provide the complete path) depending on where you have saved the file :)


Enjoy this application and if you have any issues to make it work correctly, you can always watch my [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/GHRZaiYh2Ac) or [contact me](mailto:kevin.rosamont@rdata.lu).
